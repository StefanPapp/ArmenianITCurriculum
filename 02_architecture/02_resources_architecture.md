# General
## Rationale
Data Platform is about running software on top of hardware (mostly a distributed environment).
There are some resources that are more about concepts and less on the technical implementation details on platforms. It makes sense to learn them aside from technologies as technologies change, but concept not.
## Books
Designing Data Intensive Applications: This amazing book describes all the pitfalls you can run into when you design a data platform.
Big Data: Principles and best practices: From the inventor of the lambda architecture
# Docker
Rationale
There is no way around docker, if you want to learn about data platforms. You will need Docker to build functionality.
