# Profile: DevOps

A DevOps Engineer operates and build IT platforms. He does an outstanding job, if the platform he builds can be recreated within one click and deployment of new releases is frictionless.

A DevOps Engineer understands both worlds of Operations and Engineers. He supports engineers in their efforts to innovate and the operations in their goal to stay robust and secure.

We can see also many specialisations down the road such as Security, Network, Operating Systems.

## Level 0: Entry Level
An engineer supports operating platforms. He inquires about incidents and problems and passes the information on to more experienced engineers who solve the problems.

### Minimum Qualification
- Start applications on a Linux OS, navigate through folder structures, list files and understand access rights.
- Read system logs and explore problems.
- Discuss Hardware details and differences about CPUs, RAM, etc.
- Set up a Test Environment with a plain Linux OS installation themselves.

## Level 1: Novice Level
Solve easier problems and hand more difficult ones over to a Senior Engineer.

### Minimum Qualification
- Set up a common Linux distribution (Ubuntu, CentOS).
- Read out basic stats on linux with ip, hostname, htop.
- Install Software with package managers (apt, yum).
- Edit files with an advanced text editor.
- Install a common database (e.g. MySQL) and run basic CRUD SQL command
- Create a simple bash script to combine various commands
- Using grep to parse error logs
- Explain details on networking and understand concepts of ethernet, network setups.
- Build up passphrase less SSH connections (local and with remote notes).
- Instantiate Virtual Environments in at least one cloud provider

## Level 2: Advanced Level
At this level, a SysOps Engineer can solve many production problems.

### Minimum Qualification
- Start Docker containers and VMs.
- Reason about differences between Hardware Virtualisation (Virtualisation) and OS Virtualisation (Containers) and explain advantages of each approach.
- Set up a basic multi node environment with a Hypervisor or Docker.
- Start, stop and pause services, kill jobs.
- Explain the difference between Cloud Computing and On-Premise and to explain the up- and downsides of each option
- Write a Python 3 application that orchestrates basic processes using Cloud.
- Discuss serial formats such as JSON, XML and YAML.
- Set up a basic cluster (non production) in the cloud or on premise alone,
- Read out resource information and benchmark data.

## Level 3: Expert Level

### Minimum Qualification
- Create Docker Images, write Dockerfiles and build Docker images. Upload images to docker registry
- Open Ports for Docker Images
- Able to troubleshoot network problems,

- Explain the concept of data nodes and name nodes and how data is distributed on them
- Handling of intermediate concepts of Python 3 such as modules, exception handling, packaging, lint, class methods, properties.
- Manage Distributed Environment
- Strong Kubernetes skills

## Level 4: Mastery Level
- Ability to adjust to the requirements of difficult environments and solve problems

### Minimum Qualification
