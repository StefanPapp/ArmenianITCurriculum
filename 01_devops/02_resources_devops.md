# Hardware Basics
## Rationale
Improving your hardware skills helps in all projects connected with distributed data processing platforms. If the Data Science platform is wrongly sized, the performance degrades and processes are not finished in time.

## Books 
UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook : According to my research this is one of the most common referred book to build up a base knowledge of Linux
Mastering Modern Linux: Also often referred book, released in June 2018 so pretty up to date when writing these pages
Academic Books and Books exceeding the scope
This is a list of more or less a bit more academic books on OS. Some of them are old. I consider these books just as a reference, if you really want to dig into details. 
A. S. Tanenbaum. Modern Operating Systems. Pearson Education, 
W. Stallings. Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles. 
A. Silberschatz, P. B. Galvin, and G. Gagne. Operating System Concepts.

The Design of the UNIX Operating System by Maurice J. Bach (a bit outdated)
Linux Kernel Development (3rd Edition) by Robert Love
UNIX Internals: The New Frontiers Uresh Vahalia (outdated)
Linux Kernel Architecture by Wolfgang Mauerer
UNIX Systems for Modern Architecture
Charles Petzold (whatever book on Windows)
